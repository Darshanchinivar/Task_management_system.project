# **Task Management System**  

## **Overview**  
The **Task Management System** is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage tasks, track progress, and handle leave applications. Built using **HTML, CSS, javascript and MySQL**, the system provides a structured workflow for users and administrators. It features a **role-based authentication system with three login roles**: User, Admin, and Registration.  

## **Key Features**  

### 🔐 **Multi-Role Authentication System**  
The system supports three login roles:  

1. **User Login**  
   - Existing users log in using their **email and password**.  
   - Users can **view, update, and manage their assigned tasks**.  
   - They can **apply for leave** and check their **leave status**.  
   - Secure **session management** ensures safe authentication.  

2. **User Registration**  
   - New users can register by providing:  
     - **Full Name**  
     - **Email**  
     - **Password**  
     - **Phone Number**  
   - Once registered, users can log in and manage tasks.  

3. **Admin Login**  
   - Admin logs in using their **admin email and password**.  
   - Admin has **full control** over the system, including:  
     - **Creating tasks** for users.  
     - **Managing tasks** (updating/deleting).  
     - **Viewing leave applications** submitted by users.  
     - **Approving or rejecting leave requests**.  

### 📝 **Task Management**  
- Users can **Complete, update, and delete** their tasks.  
- Tasks can be categorized by **priority and deadline**.  
- Task status tracking (e.g., **Pending, In Progress, Completed**).  
- Admin assigns tasks to users.  

### 📅 **Leave Management**  
- Users can **request leave** through the system.  
- The **Admin reviews and approves/rejects** leave applications.  
- Users can **track the status** of their leave requests.  

### 🔒 **Secure Session Handling**  
- Sessions are utilized for **secure authentication**.  
- **Session expiration** prevents unauthorized access.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, javascript (for UI design and responsiveness).    
- **Database**: MySQL (for storing users, tasks, and leave records).  
- **Authentication**: Email-based login with password security.  

 ## **Future Enhancements**  
- Adding a **Manager role** to oversee user tasks.  
- Implementing **task reminders** via email or notifications.  
- Enhancing UI with **JavaScript for better interactivity**.  
- Developing an **analytics dashboard** to track task progress and efficiency.  
- Adding a **mobile-friendly version** for better accessibility.
